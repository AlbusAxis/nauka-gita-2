  <p>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed<br>
With a word she can get what she came for<br>
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure<br>
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings<br>
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings<br>
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven<br>
You know<br>
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west<br>
And my spirit is crying for leaving<br>
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees<br>
And the voices of those who stand looking<br>
That's you<br>
And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune<br>
Then the piper will lead us to reason<br>
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long<br>
And the forests will echo with laughter<br>
Remember laughter?<br>
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...<br>
And it makes me wonder<br>
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now<br>
It's just a spring clean for the May queen<br>
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br>
There's still time to change the road you're on<br>
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know<br>
The piper's calling you to join him<br>
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br>
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?<br>
And as we wind on down the road<br>
Our shadows taller than our soul<br>
There walks a lady we all know<br>
Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
How everything still turns to gold!!!!!<br>
And if you listen very hard<br>
The tune will come to you at last<br>
When all is one and one is all, that's what it is<br>
To be a rock and not to roll, oh yeah<br>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven</p>
